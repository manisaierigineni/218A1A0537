    <h3>Section-1</h3>
    <p>Modern software development processes have moved away from the conventional waterfall model, in which 
        each stage of the development process is dependent on completion of the previous stage.
        The economic benefits inherent in transitioning from the conventional waterfall model to an iterative 
        development process are significant but difficult to quantify. As one benchmark of the expected economic 
        impact of process improvement, consider the process exponent parameters of the COCOMO II model. 
        (Appendix B provides more detail on the COCOMO model) This exponent can range from 1.01 (virtually no 
        diseconomy of scale) to 1.26 (significant diseconomy of scale). The parameters that govern the value of the 
        process exponent are application precedentedness, process flexibility, architecture risk resolution, team 
        cohesion, and software process maturity. 
        The following paragraphs map the process exponent parameters of CO COMO II to my top 10 principles of 
        a modern process. </p>
